#Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and compute the area.

#NOTE: area of circle = pi * r**2

#Possible solution: Use sympy
#from sympy import *


#Solution:
pi = 3.14159265359

radius = input("Enter the radius: ")
area = pi * int(radius)**2
print("The area of the circle is: ", area)
