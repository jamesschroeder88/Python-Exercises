#Write a Python program to accept a filename from the user and print the extension of that.
#Sample filename : abc.java
#Output : java

#filename = input from user
#extension = whatever is after the "." in filename

filename = input("Enter the filename: ")

extension = filename.split(".",1) #splits at "." --> then makes a list with index [0,1]
print(extension[1]) #prints index one of extension list
